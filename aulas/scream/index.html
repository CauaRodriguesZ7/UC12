            The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. <br> 
            The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik (Scream), and the German title under which <br>
            it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature). The agonized face <br>
            in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in art, seen <br>
            as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, had <br>
            a formative influence on the Expressionist movement. <br>
            Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sun's light turned <br>
            the clouds "a blood red". He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature". Scholars have located <br>
            the spot to a fjord overlooking Oslo[2] and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, <br>
            ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister's commitment <br>
            at a nearby lunatic asylum.
